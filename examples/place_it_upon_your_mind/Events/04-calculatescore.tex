Calculating from {RENOWN}, {SURVIVAL}, {BEATNEVEREVER}, {TREASURE_DARKSPINE},
{COMPASSION}:
% Use '*' to read a stat
\set{MTB_FAVOR = *RENOWN}
\set{MTB_FAVOR += *SURVIVAL}
% multiplication only works in combination with eval
\set{MTB_FAVOR += *BEATNEVEREVER * 5}
\set{MTB_FAVOR += *TREASURE_DARKSPINE * 5}
\set{MTB_FAVOR -= *COMPASSION}

% Be aware, reads made with this curly bracket syntax in paragraphs are all
% substituted when arriving into the event.
% You must add a transition to make it visible this way
% AND: the [Continue] rule is not actually automatic, it only triggers if there
% are at least 2 paragraphs
Which is...

\if{MTB_FAVOR >= 1} \go{fen_test_set2a}
\go{fen_test_set2b}

\event{fen_test_set2a}
Calculated: {MTB_FAVOR}, which is >= 1

\event{fen_test_set2b}
