% the \event command completely defines an event, and will overwrite a
% previous event with the same name if it exists

\event{lair_reflection_act3}
\image{Act3_Reflection} % unlike xml events, Backgrounds are searched in mod first
The sight of your current Self fills you with pride.

\option /EndEvent
% \go must be the last command in a transition (after all parameters are set).
% But an \option paragraph may have several \go's, if noninteractive conditions are used
\transition{fade} \go{MainLair}

% You could also use the \eventModify command, to append content to the
% previous event of the same name
% This example would become simply:
%
% \eventModify{lair_reflection_act3}
% \image{Act3_Reflection}
